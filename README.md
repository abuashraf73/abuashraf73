**Hi 👋, I am Abu Ashraf.**

I am a 28 year web developer from 🇧🇩 Bangladesh, living in 🇩🇪 Germany now. 

I’ve always been keen on problem-solving, an independent introvert, and a technophile obsessed with the latest devices/technologies. My fuel is Cola and Steak. 🥩🥤

I have 4 years of experience working in the industry for 3 different companies combining Asia and Europe. Today, I’m working as a junior full-stack developer with an amazing team at Fastlane, and am getting into React JS on my own time. 🚀 🎰

I’m familiar with a variety of programming languages, including JavaScript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, Python, and NoSQL databases, but I’m always adding new skills to my repertoire. I want to learn something new every year. 🥅🎯

I’m also eager to meet other software engineers in the area, so feel free to connect! 🍻

🔭 I’m currently working on Angular/Ionic, NodeJS and Firebase.

🌱 I’m currently learning React JS.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Javascript projects.

🤔 I’m looking for help with React.
